# Alpaca API Support
This repository is meant to act as a support channel for general issues and questions about the Alpaca API. If your question relates to a specific API library maintained by Alpaca, please open your issue in that library's repository instead. Please also check our [API documentation](https://docs.alpaca.markets/) and [Brokerage FAQ](https://support.alpaca.markets/hc/en-us/) for answers before opening an issue.

## Opening Tickets
Before opening a new ticket to ask a question or request a feature, please search in the [existing issues](https://github.com/alpacahq/Alpaca-API/issues) to see if there's a similar ticket open. If so, feel free to add your thoughts as a comment, or just give the ticket a thumbs-up reaction to indicate that you feel it's important.

If you don't find an existing issue similar enough to your situation, you can open a new issue with as much information as possible. If you experienced unexpected behavior while using the API, please include as much information about the scenario that occurred as you can. Here are some pieces of information we will likely need to help you:
* Date and time on which the issue occurred.
* Whether or not you were using the paper trading API.
* What you were trying to do.
* What you expected to happen and what actually happened.
Please also include any other information you can provide, such as sample code (with sensitive information removed.)
